    <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
<p>The <b>CBS Building</b> is a 38-story tower at 51 West 52nd Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Built from 1962 to 1965, it is the headquarters of the American broadcasting network CBS, which owned the structure until 2021. The only skyscraper designed by Eero Saarinen, the building occupies the eastern side of Sixth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets, near the Museum of Modern Art. The interior spaces and furnishings were designed by Saarinen and Florence Knoll Bassett. Its nickname, "Black Rock", is derived from the design of its facade, which consists of angled dark-gray granite piers alternating with dark tinted glass. The CBS Building has won several architectural awards, but according to critic Ada Louise Huxtable, "The dark dignity that appeals to architectural sophisticates puts off the public, which tends to reject it as funereal." The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the CBS Building as a city landmark in 1997</p>
